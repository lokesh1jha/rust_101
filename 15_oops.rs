What Is OOP?
Object oriented programming roughly refers to programming languages that have a number of iconic features:

Encapsulation - Associating data and functions into the conceptual unit of a single type called an object.
Abstraction - Hiding data and function members to obfuscate implementation details of an object.
Polymorphism - The ability to interact with objects of different types through one interface.
Inheritance - The ability to inherit data and behavior from other objects.


## Rust Is Not OOP
Rust lacks inheritance of data and behavior in any meaningful way.

Structs cannot inherit fields from a parent struct.
Structs cannot inherit functions from a parent struct.
That said, Rust implements many programming language features, so that you might not mind this lacking.
